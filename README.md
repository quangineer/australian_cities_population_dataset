# australian_cities_population_dataset
analyze australian cities and population

the dataset is very orderly. I don't have to sort it in the list. However, the hurdle is how to write it in different ways. More specifically, using purely(or at least as much as possible) Python, SQL/Pandas (resulting to main.py and main1.py, respectively) combined with matplotlib to practice languages and library. 
main.py also show how to differentiate sort and sorted and get nested list and a bit of calculation. 
We also can change the color (reference for the color : matplotlib.cm colors)
